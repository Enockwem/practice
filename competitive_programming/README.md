# Competitive programming.
This topic combines two major roles which are designing algorithms and implementing the Algorithms. Therefore, competitive programming deals with Algorithm handling. I am mostly gonna be using Java because it is the language that I am comfortable with though most competitive programmers use C++.

Below are the concepts that are best for practice for competitive programming.
- Basic techniques.
    - Input / Output.
    - Working with numbers.
    - Shortening code.
    - Mathematics
