## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript DOM

### What I learned

I have learned more about the grid-layout. I have also used the flex layout. Using the javascript DOM file to interact with the HTML file.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h5>Total <br><span>/ person</span></h5>
```
```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 80px);
grid-template-rows: repeat(3,30px);
gap: 10px;
```
```js
// This function reloads the index.html page.
function(){
    location.reload()
}
```

### Continued development
Learning more about the Javascript DOM object. The Grid layout and the flex layout.
